## Rolling Circle Amplification

Rolling circle amplification is a process in which a short DNA or RNA primer is amplified to create a long single-stranded DNA or RNA using its respective polymerases and a circular DNA template. This enzymatic process proves to be a powerful DNA amplification technique that plays a significant role in biomedical research and nanotechnology. RCA (Rolling Circle Amplification) is used to develop multiple sensitive diagnostic methods that have different targets such as proteins, cells, nucleic acids, and other small molecules. In addition, because the RCA products are circular in structure due to the circular DNA template, the products have been used to create complicated DNA structures such as nanotubes, nanoribbons, and other DNA materials. These specific RCA products have been used for drug delivery, bioseparation, biodetection, and other technologies. In addition, RCA is a powerful tool for amplifying signals in immunoassays, especially ELISA, and as such has become a very versatile amplification tool with a menagerie of applications in genomics, proteomics, diagnosis, biosensing, and enzyme development. 

A typical RCA experiment works through the use of five main components: DNA Polymerase (such as Phi29 DNA Polymerase) or RNA polymerase, an applicable buffer, DNA or RNA primer, single-stranded DNA template, and dNTPs for elongation. The first step is to ligate the two ends of the single-stranded DNA into one circular template, which can either be done with a ligation primer and enzyme, such as T4 DNA ligase, or with just a template-free ligation enzyme, such as CircLigase [3], shown in Figure 1A. The target sequence is often used as the primer for extension, RNA or DNA, and can serve as a ligation primer as well. Once the primer anneals to the newly formed circular template, the polymerase will attach to the primer and elongate the sequence. While this elongation occurs, the circular template starts to rotate, or “roll”, pushing the previously existing primer and extension off the template. A derivative of RCA, known as Hyperbranched RCA (HRCA), exists as well, in which multiple primers anneal to the circular template, and multiple polymerases can attach and simultaneously extend the replicating sequence, to produce many more replicated strands (shown in Figure 1D). Variations of approaches can be shown in Figure 1B, 1C, and 1D, and further analyses paths can be shown by 1E, 1F, and 1G. } 

RCA is a powerful tool for amplifying full-length HBV genomes and will be especially useful for the study of occult or inactive HBV infections and patients undergoing antiviral treatment. It can also be used to probe HBV cccDNA, the crucial intermediate in viral persistence and the archive of resistance mutations. (could use this also)

One of the main implementations of Rolling Circle Amplification is as a replacement for PCA as the replication process for genetic material for sequencing. For example, with the amounts of genetic material generally submitted for Sanger sequencing, it only takes around five hours to get enough genetic material to perform Sanger sequencing. The pipeline for Sanger sequencing then takes another seven or so hours, which allows for the sequencing of genetic material to be turned around in one day. Now if we compare this with the normal PCA pipeline, due to the need for plasmid preparation (miniprep), to go from genetic material to sequencing becomes a multi-day process. Essentially, RCA allows for the replication of genetic material without the need to perform the amount of preparation of the material that PCA, the current industry standard, requires.

One useful application of RCA is in enzyme development using random mutagenesis. Random mutagenesis is usually paired with genetic selection or high throughput screening in order to purposely replicate enzymes with mutations to develop innovative enzymes that can be used in ways that cannot even be predicted ahead of time. The most common random mutagenesis method in use is an error prone version of PCR, which is able to induce mutations in its replication process by weakening the accuracy of DNA Polymerase. While this is a normal and common practice, its very tedious and cumbersome and requires many steps, including digestion with restriction enzymes, separation with electrophoresis, and ligation into a vector, all of which can sum up to over a day’s worth of processes. However if we were to use an error-prone RCA method instead of PCR, the process becomes a lot less cumbersome for multiple reasons. Firstly, it doesn’t need specific primers as it can use random hexamers as universal primers. Another significant advantage is that RCA does not require a thermal-cycler due to the isothermal nature of the method, not to mention the fact that the end products of RCA are ready to be used for the direct formation of E. Coli, which can be extremely useful moving forward. It’s easy to see that this specific type of pipeline is aided significantly by the use of RCA as opposed to PCR (See Figure 2).

Rolling Circle Amplification is used frequently for efficient isothermal DNA amplification in molecular diagnoses. Even though polymerase chain reaction is a very popular and reliable technique, its applicability is limited by its dependence on heating and cooling cycles. The heating step of polymerase chain reaction can damage biological models, and therefore an isothermal approach to DNA/RNA amplification, such as RCA is preferable. The circular templates used allow for amplification to be over a thousand-fold off of a single binding event, therefore, making RCA ideal for the ultrasensitive detection used in diagnostics. In addition, Rolling Circle Amplification, using the specific bacteriophage phi29, DNA polymerase aids in determining diagnoses of geminiviruses and essentially all viruses with small-single stranded circular DNA genomes[2]. Viral DNA components of geminiviruses can be detected using RCA, allowing for such diagnoses. 

A specific example of this case is described below. In various tropical and subtropical countries around the world, geminiviruses have a history of destroying large regions of crops, and a combination of PCR and RFLP (Restriction fragment length polymorphism) have been used for diagnostic tools in this field. However, developing countries are the major regions in which geminiviruses attack, and a combination of RCA/RFLP offers a low-cost procedure alternative for diagnosis that can be performed in lower standard laboratories, but still with high accuracy. Circular DNA was extracted from plants that were positive and negative for infection by various geminiviruses. After purification of the DNA, RCA was performed as an alternative to PCR with Phi29 Polymerase. Through gel electrophoresis of various geminivirus infected plants, these amplified sequences showed clear differences between infected versus non-infected plants’ DNA. Further sequencing was then performed on this RCA-amplified DNA and through cycle-sequencing, 938 nucleotides were sequenced in one go with 99.5% fidelity. This shows that for this use-case, PCR and various other expensive cloning procedures are unnecessary, and RCA provides a cost-effective alternative[2].

The DNA amplified from RCA can additionally be characterized by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis and directly sequenced up to 900 bases in a single run, avoiding other obstacles and allowing for quicker analysis. There are many other advantages to using RCA such as the lack of expensive devices, its simplicity, and the characterization of all infecting circular DNA components, thus, making it a widely used mechanism for diagnostics.
